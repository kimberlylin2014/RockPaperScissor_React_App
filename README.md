## Rock Paper Scissor Game Built in React
* This is a interactive Rock Paper Scissor game where each user selects a mystery card. When both users have selected their cards, the play button will become available. When the play button is clicked, it will reveal each player's card, the winner of the game or if there is a tie. Player can choose to replay the game.
## Emphasis
*  Building the game using multiple React Components
*  Passing methods from parent to child components
*  Changing state and passing state down as props (downward data flow)

## Resources
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
